            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I am a student currently studying Information Technology and Graphic Design. I graduated from a high school early
                college program after taking community college courses for several years before my freshman year of college.
                I am also an artist, and I have been learning to create digital art using software such as Photoshop, Illustractor, 
                and Clip Studio Paint.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am interested in web design, graphic design, and video game concept art. I hope to eventually start
                my own business to work as a freelancer designing websites, logos and icons, as well as creating
                enviornment, costume and character concept art for video games. For more information about me, visit
                <a href = "./html/my_resume.html"> my resume </a> and <a href = "./html/my_fun_facts.html"> my fun facts </a>
